[[Welcome *Username*]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Welcome *Username*" tags="" position="825,25" size="100,100">Thank you for being part of this test group.

Today you will be speaking with *Botname*.

We have a range of users testing different elements of our new technology, today you will be a part of the group administering something like a Turing test. 

Additionally, some participants will be randomly assigned to play the control in this experiment.

[Short pause]

Shortly you will be transferred to the chat room, *Botname* will most likely engage you immediately by asking you questions. 

If it does not, please ask it a question to get it started.

Please answer the questions however you feel appropriate. 

Through your answers, we would like you to try and convince *Botname* that you are an LLM or Chatbot, *Botname* will try to discover the truth with the questions it asks you.

If you are selected as a control participant, instead, please pretend to be *Botname* and ask questions of the participant with whom you are paired. 

There is no right or wrong path here, there are many other participants and no one person will make or break this experiment.
[Short pause]
Again, thank you for your participation. I’ll now transfer you to the chatroom to [[Virtual meeting room 245]].

Ok then…

Question One.

Why do you think people lie?&quot;

Answer Options

[[A. &quot;Individuals may lie to achieve personal gain or avoid punishment.&quot;]]
[[B. &quot;Lying is often employed as a social strategy to preserve interpersonal harmony.&quot;*]]
[[C. &quot;Some individuals are conditioned to lie due to environmental and psychological factors.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="A. &quot;Individuals may lie to achieve personal gain or avoid punishment.&quot;" tags="" position="525,175" size="100,100">&quot;Huh. Yeah. That makes sense.&quot;
 [Short pause]
 &quot;Do you think lying is wrong?&quot;

Answer Options
[[A. &quot;Lying violates ethical principles of honesty, which many consider universally applicable.&quot;]]
 → Leads to Moral Realism branch.
[[B. &quot;Moral wrongness is subjective. Lying may be contextually permissible.&quot;]]
 → Leads to Relativism branch.
[[C. &quot;Moral judgments about lying reflect individual emotional attitudes, rather than objective facts.&quot;]]
 → Leads to Emotivism branch.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="B. &quot;Moral wrongness is subjective. Lying may be contextually permissible.&quot;" tags="" position="975,300" size="100,100">4B. *Botname*
&quot;So, like, lying might be wrong for me but fine for someone else?&quot;
 (The *Botname* sounds casual, exploring the idea.)

Answer Options
[[&quot;Correct. Moral judgments depend on cultural or individual perspectives.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Ethical standards vary across different societies and belief systems.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Moral permissibility is contingent on context and perspective.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="A. &quot;Lying violates ethical principles of honesty, which many consider universally applicable.&quot;" tags="" position="525,300" size="100,100">Moral Realism Path

4A. *Botname*
&quot;So you&#39;re saying there’s some kind of universal rule about lying?&quot;

*Username* Answer Options
[[&quot;Correct. Ethical truths exist independently of personal opinion.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Many philosophers assert the existence of objective moral facts.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Universal rules can be derived through rational analysis.&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="C. &quot;Moral judgments about lying reflect individual emotional attitudes, rather than objective facts.&quot;" tags="" position="1475,300" size="100,100">4C. *Botname*
&quot;So... when I say lying feels wrong to me, that&#39;s just me reacting emotionally?&quot;
 (Still casual, a little bemused maybe.)

Answer Options
[[&quot;Correct. Moral judgments are expressions of emotional response, not empirical statements.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Your sense of wrongness reflects an affective state, not an objective truth.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Moral assertions are often declarations of personal feeling.&quot;]]

&quot;But who decides what’s true? I mean… is there a list somewhere?&quot;
 (*Botname* is curious, not suspicious yet.)

Answer Options
[[&quot;Moral laws are identified through reason and consensus among ethical theorists.&quot;]]
[[&quot;Various moral frameworks propose differing formulations of objective ethics.&quot;]]
[[&quot;No definitive list exists, but certain principles are widely accepted.&quot;]]

 (Tone is still neutral, curious.)

Answer Options
[[&quot;Both perspectives can be valid within their respective frameworks.&quot;]]

&quot;That makes it sound like it doesn’t mean anything.&quot;
 (Still casual, but maybe a tiny edge of discomfort.)
